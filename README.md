# Medical_Appointments
Medical Appointments No Shows is an analytics project, associated with Udacity. The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. After importing, cleaning, wrangling, and exploring the data, the project answers to two main questions:
* Why do 20% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?
* Which age interval does care the most about their health?
